# STEPS

1. npm init -y (create package.json)
2. npm i express, nodemon (added node_modules and package.lock.json)
#  package.json is for declaring project metadata and dependencies, while 
# package-lock.json is for specifying and locking down the precise versions of those dependencies for consistent installations.
# the "node_modules" directory contains third-party packages and libraries that your project depends on.

3. Created file-server.js, .env, .gitignore

4. added scripts for start and server- on package.json 

5. npm i dotenv, morgan
